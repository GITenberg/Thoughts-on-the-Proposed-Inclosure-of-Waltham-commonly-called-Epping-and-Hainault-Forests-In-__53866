5</span>THOUGHTS, &amp;c. &amp;c.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> local knowledge acquired by
occasional residence, for many years past, in the Forest of
Waltham and the neighbourhood, and its having been the favourite
spot where I have indulged in occasional relaxation from
professional pursuits, my attention has been drawn to the notice
given of an intended application to Parliament for an inclosure
of that and also of Hainault Forest, and the controversy which
has taken place respecting such a proceeding has induced me to
peruse the papers that have been published on the subject, and to
reduce to writing a few observations thereon; and, although my
remarks are intended to apply more particularly to the
neighbourhood of <a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
6</span>Woodford, yet I think they will be found not inapplicable
to the interests of the landed proprietors in general within the
precincts of these Forests.</p>
<p>I, some time since, understood, from authority, the
correctness of which I have no reason to doubt, that it was not
the intention of the Crown to press for a general inclosure of
these Forests, but merely to obtain a reasonable compensation (to
be settled by the Commissioners under the proposed Act) for
disafforesting both Waltham and Hainault Forests, and
extinguishing the rights of the Crown therein.&nbsp; I hare
considered the subject with much attention, and I confess that I
could hardly have pictured to myself any thing so desirable to
the owners of landed property in and adjoining to these Forests,
as their being relieved from the rights of the Crown, rights from
which, in point of fact, the Crown derives no sort of benefit;
but, on the contrary, incurs an annual expense of &pound;300, (as
appears by the 15th Report of the Commissioners of Woods and
Forests,) and which have been, for many years past, a continual
source of <a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
7</span>complaint on the part of the land-owners and
inhabitants.&nbsp; I was, therefore, much surprised, on perusing
the resolutions passed, on the 26th November last, at a Meeting
of the Freeholders and others, possessing landed property in the
parish of Woodford, to find them so strongly deprecate the
proposed inclosure.</p>
<p>As to the proposition respecting Hainault Forest:&mdash;the
principal part of it, which is occupied by the growth of timber,
is so low and swampy, that no human being would ever think of
building in such a situation, and the land could not be brought
into cultivation without an enormous expense in grubbing up the
timber, and draining the soil.&nbsp; If, therefore, we give the
Commissioners for the Inclosure credit for a reasonable degree of
judgment and discretion, it is within this part of the Forest, so
well calculated for the growth of timber, that they would
undoubtedly appropriate the 2,000 acres to be inclosed as a
nursery for that purpose, and for which it would be a situation
peculiarly advantageous, on account of its easy communication
with water-carriage and the dock-yard at Woolwich.&nbsp; <a
name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span>I really cannot
discover what injury could be done to the land-owners surrounding
that spot, who, according to the plan proposed, would have a
thousand acres of uninclosed land left subject only to the custom
of the manor, within which their lands happen to lie, and totally
free from the intervention of the forty days court; the frequent
and inconvenient interference of which, in the exercise of the
duty imposed on them of protecting the rights of the Crown, and
preventing the deer being deprived of the herbage, has been so
generally complained of by persons within its jurisdiction.</p>
<p>At the meeting held at Woodford, on the 26th of November last,
certain resolutions were entered into, in which the persons
passing them seemed to have been impressed with an idea, that a
general inclosure was meant to be forced upon them, which, I
believe, it never was in the contemplation of the Commissioners
of Woods and Forests to attempt; and, in their eagerness to
oppose such a measure, they have in my opinion, overlooked the
beneficial effect which must necessarily result from a partial <a
name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>inclosure, and
passed some resolutions founded on erroneous principles; for
instance, the first resolution asserts &ldquo;that no injury is
sustained in the said parish by the depasturing of the
deer.&rdquo;&nbsp; Now, it is most extraordinary how such an
allegation could be made and sanctioned by the majority at such a
meeting; for, to my certain knowledge, for upwards of thirty
years past, the depredations committed by the deer have been a
continual subject of complaint by the inhabitants of the parish
of Woodford.</p>
<p>In the next resolution it is stated, that, &ldquo;at the date
of the 15th Report of the Commissioners of Woods and Forests, it
appeared, by the evidence of Bamber Gascoyne, Esq. that the utter
destruction of his Majesty&rsquo;s deer had, at that time, almost
taken place, and that the persons present at that meeting had yet
to learn that the number of deer had so materially increased,
since that Report was made, as to render a total disafforestation
or general inclosure necessary.&rdquo;&nbsp; If those gentlemen
are really disposed to learn what the state of the deer now is in
the Forest, <a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
10</span>they have only to ride about for a few hours in the
retired parts of it, and they will see such herds as will easily
convince them, that (presuming the Report, above alluded to, to
be strictly accurate in this respect) the numbers must have
increased prodigiously within the last twenty-five years; and
this may be readily accounted for, when it is admitted that only
twenty one brace annually are killed, for the use of persons
claiming a right to venison from the Forests, (and I believe not
a single head is destroyed for his Majesty&rsquo;s use,) and
consequently the increase of these animals, which, in various
parts of the Forests, may frequently be seen thirty or forty in a
herd, must, in a very great degree, exceed the annual
destruction.&nbsp; I will venture to assume, and I am sure I
shall be borne out, on inquiry, that there are not less than 600
head of deer in Waltham and Hainault Forests; and, allowing but
one-half of these to be does, they would, on a moderate
calculation, now give an increase of 300 head annually, or at
least of 200, allowing for those killed, destroyed, or lost, by
various contingencies.</p>
<p>It is not in the power of the Crown, in opposition <a
name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 11</span>to the
proprietors of land within any district, to enforce a general
inclosure; and although, from local circumstances, there may be
such well-founded objections to the measure as fully to justify
the feelings of the gentlemen at that meeting in the resolutions
they passed, yet it seems to me that, on the principle of
commuting the rights of the Crown, and effecting inclosures to
such an extent, only, as would satisfy the Crown for a sacrifice
of those rights, they reject a proposal which it would be most
desirable for all the parishes within the Forests, and for the
parish of Woodford in particular, to have carried into
effect.&nbsp; The quantity of waste land in the parish of
Woodford is estimated at about 300 acres, and the Crown claims
for its interests therein about one-third of that number.&nbsp;
If a bill were brought into Parliament for inclosing such
proportion only as the Commissioners should deem the Crown
entitled to, or to allot a certain proportion to be specified in
the Act, it could be productive of no advantage whatever to the
parish of Woodford to have 100 acres of land inclosed for the
growth of timber, nor would it answer <a name="page12"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 12</span>the purpose of the Crown to have an
inclosure of a similar, or, in many instances, a much less
quantity allotted in different parishes for that purpose; a very
different appropriation of such land would, I have no doubt, be
much more desirable; and the plan I would suggest is, that the
Commissioners should have a power of selling the lands allotted
in lieu of the rights of the Crown, and that the Bill should
contain clauses, directing the Commissioners to make their
allotments in parcels of not less than two acres, but not
exceeding five or ten, and preferring those situations where the
proprietor of any dwelling-house or grounds should express to the
Commissioners his assent to the inclosure of waste lying near or
contiguous to such house or grounds, and that such owner should
be allowed a right of pre-emption of the allotment so inclosed,
at a price to be set thereon by two surveyors, one to be
appointed on behalf of the Crown, and the other on the part of
the purchaser; such surveyors, in case of disagreement, having
power to elect a third, to decide between them.&nbsp; Now,
supposing 100 <a name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
13</span>acres to be so allotted, I would ask, if there are not
twenty houses in the parish of Woodford, the owners of which
would be glad to have an addition of five acres of contiguous
waste inclosed; and if there are not, in every other parish
within the Forest, proprietors of land who would be glad to have
such a partial inclosure as would afford them an addition of a
like quantity of land.&nbsp; It clearly appears to me, that an
inclosure, carried into effect upon this principle, and to this
extent, would be a most desirable measure for the proprietors of
houses and lands in every parish on the Forest: and there should
be a clause restraining the Commissioners from making inclosures
within a certain distance of any dwelling-house, without the
consent of the owner, so that no one should have the inclosure
brought to his door, without his own consent.&nbsp; This plan
would, in all probability, not occasion a single additional
building; the 36,000 paupers, of whom so dreadful a picture has
been drawn, (and whose numbers appear to have been calculated
upon the visionary foundation of some antient adage,) would all
vanish, and the new inclosures, <a name="page14"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 14</span>which it is highly probable would, in
most instances, be converted into ornamental grounds, and be
adorned with new plantations, would add greatly to the bounty of
the country; and a very abundant portion of waste would still be
left to preserve the rural scenery, for which this district has
been so much and so deservedly admired.&nbsp; The value of the
landed properly, I have no doubt, instead of being deteriorated,
by pursuing this system, would be very considerably
increased.</p>
<p>Let us now look forward to the situation in which the
proprietors of houses and land, in these Forests, would stand as
to the remaining waste, which would become merely wastes of the
respective manors, relieved from any rights of the Crown over
them, and from the paramount power of the forty days court,
which, of course, must cease with the extinction of the
Crown&rsquo;s rights; and any proprietor wishing for an addition
of one or two acres to his premises, (which in many instances, no
doubt, it would be highly desirable to obtain,) might, on
application to the Lord of the Manor, with the consent of the
Homage Jury, <a name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
15</span>procure a grant thereof as copyhold, an advantage not
now to be obtained on almost any terms: the right of Common, too,
would be relieved from the necessity of withdrawing the cattle
during the fence months, and be general through the year.</p>
<p>There is another circumstance mentioned in the
Commissioners&rsquo; Report, about the state of the timber, in
the year 1783, which, I think, must have considerably changed
since that period, namely, &ldquo;that, out of 11,000 oaks, there
were 2,700 fit for the use of the Navy.&rdquo;&nbsp; Now, I
verily believe that, at the present time, not one-fourth of the
number could be found fit for that purpose; and, as to the 7,000
young trees, mentioned in the same Report, there are scarcely any
of them that have not, as they attained a certain age, been
converted into, and are now become, old pollards; for the right
of cutting fire-wood is, in the ideas of the lower sort of
people, confirmed and increased, by preventing trees from
becoming timber, and converting them to pollards, of which it is
the common course of the country to cut the tops for fire-wood;
and, in most parts <a name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
16</span>of the Forest, the beauty of the scenery and utility of
the timber are totally destroyed by the decapitation of the
trees.</p>
<p>In the New Forest, in the Forest of Dean, and in Marlborough
Forest, there is a great deal of beautiful forest scenery, where
the practice of reducing the trees to pollards is not permitted;
but, in much the greater part of Waltham Forest, the beauty is
totally destroyed by this practice; and, therefore, it must be a
most desirable measure, as regards the appearance of the country,
to have the rights of cutting fire-wood totally abolished.</p>
<p>I have not entered into any wild speculations, but have
confined myself to a plain and, I hope, intelligible statement of
a plan that I now see reason to hope will be carried into effect,
and, I have no doubt, will prove of real advantage to the
proprietors of houses and lands within this district.</p>
<p>As many of my readers may not have seen the last Circular
Letter, of the Surveyor of Woods and Forests, on the subject of
the inclosure, and the Heads of the intended Bill, in which the
plan submitted in the preceding <a name="page17"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 17</span>pages is meant to be adopted, I have
added copies, by way of Appendix.</p>
<p>I cannot easily imagine on what grounds any serious opposition
can be attempted to the measure now proposed, unless the
Commissioners of Woods and Forests are to be told that they shall
keep and preserve Royal Forests and extensive and useless Wastes,
with all the severity and arbitrary spirit of the barbarous days
of William Rufus, on the one hand; or that, on the other, if they
do adopt any species of inclosure, it shall be in rood <a
name="citation17"></a><a href="#footnote17"
class="citation">[17]</a> allotments, for the accommodation of
cottagers and paupers,&mdash;the inevitable consequence of which
would be that every parish in the Forest would be inundated with
persons dependent on daily labour for subsistence, where
employment for such numbers could not possibly be found, and they
must, of necessity, become burthens to the several parishes in
which they might thus be domiciled.</p>
<p>Viewing the subject, then, calmly and deliberately, with a
mind wholly unbiassed either <a name="page18"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 18</span>by local prejudices or party-spirit,
I cannot conceive a more desirable medium than the plan intended
to be carried into effect by the Bill now proposed, as it seems
not easy to devise one that can more effectually meet the wishes,
and bring to the very door of the proprietors of houses and land
within the Forests a degree of accommodation and
convenience&mdash;the want of which has been so long lamented,
owing to the insuperable difficulties of obtaining any small
inclosures or grants of land, under the existing system.</p>
<p>A clause was introduced into the Act of the 55th year of his
present Majesty, relative to Crown Lands, whereby the
Commissioners of Woods and Forests were enabled to sell the
Rights of the Crown in any small parcels of land, within any of
the Royal Forests, which adjoined or lay contiguous, or
convenient to the lands of individuals, and were of little value
for the growth of timber, or to sell the Rights of the Crown in
and over lands belonging to any of his Majesty&rsquo;s subjects,
lying within the limits aforesaid;&mdash;but the difficulties
attending the procuring grants of land under <a
name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 19</span>this power
were so great that it has been very little acted upon.</p>
<p>Whatever useful alterations or amendments in the proposed plan
can be suggested, I have no doubt will meet with a fair and
candid investigation by the Commissioners, and be made the
subject of corrections, or additional clauses, when the Bill is
before a Committee of the House of Commons.</p>
<p>I have heard the question asked by a proprietor of land, in
allusion to the proposed plan, what do the Crown give us in lieu
of the 9-32d parts, or 2810 acres we are to give up?&nbsp; The
answer is plain; in the first place, you give the Crown nothing
but what it had a right to before, and the Commissioners give up
all the Rights of the Crown, over the remainder of the 9000
acres; and one may compare it to the common case of an agreement
between the lord of a manor and the copyholders for an inclosure
and enfranchisement of the whole, would not the lord be fairly
entitled to one-third part, as a satisfaction for the rights he
gave up, and would not the copyholders be remunerated by getting
their copyholds converted to freeholds, and <a
name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 20</span>their commons
to valuable inclosures; and, in this case, the remaining 23-32d
parts, or 6190 acres, being discharged from the Rights of the
Crown, may either be enjoyed as common, or may be inclosed at any
future time, if the proprietors of land should agree in such a
measure.&mdash;At present, the majority appear to be against a
general inclosure; and, as far as the beauty of the country is at
stake, I think they are right, for that certainly is an object of
no small importance in a district so near the metropolis; but
that will not be affected by an inclosure to the extent only
proposed by the intended Bill.</p>

21</span>APPENDIX.</h2>
<p style="text-align: right">Office of Woods, &amp;c.<br />
Whitehall-Place,<br />
30th March, 1818.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,</p>
<p>I am directed by the Commissioners of His Majesty&rsquo;s
Woods, &amp;c. to acquaint you, that since the date of my
Circular Letter, in November last, stating the outlines of the
measure then proposed for vesting in his Majesty certain parts of
Hainault, Waltham, or Epping Forests, they have received various
Memorials and Representations from, or on behalf of, the Lords of
Manors, Freeholders, and others, having or claiming Rights over
those Forests;&mdash;from those communications, it appears that
an opinion has been very generally entertained, that it was in
contemplation to <span class="GutSmall">COMPEL</span> a Division
and Inclosure in severalty of the whole of the Wastes within the
boundaries of the said Forests, and that the greatest part of the
objections, which have been stated to the proposals of the
Commissioners, are founded upon misapprehension;&mdash;the
Commissioners are, therefore, desirous that it should <a
name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 22</span>be distinctly
understood, that it never was their intention to urge the measure
of a general Inclosure of those Wastes contrary to the wishes of
the majority of the Freeholders, and that their only object will
be, to obtain for His Majesty separate Allotments of such extent
in the whole, as shall be equivalent to his Rights and Interests
in that Property; leaving the residue to be occupied by the
Proprietors as they may think fit, freed and discharged from the
Jurisdiction of the Forest Courts, from the Controul of Forest
Officers, from the pasturage of the King&rsquo;s Deer, and from
all other Forestal Rights of the Crown.</p>
<p>The Commissioners have, therefore, determined to confine their
Proceedings to this Object, and having given the best
Consideration in their power to the Communications and
Suggestions contained in the Memorials and Representations above
referred to, I have received their Commands to send, for your
information, the inclosed Heads of the Bill now intended to be
proposed to Parliament, in which the Commissioners have modified
their former Proposals, with a view to the interests and local
convenience of the owners of Property in and adjoining those
Forests, as far as they deem to be compatible with their public
Duty.</p>
<p>It having been mentioned, in my former Letter, that a Public
Meeting would probably be convened for the purpose of considering
any details or matters of local convenience which it might have
been desirable <a name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
23</span>to settle, previous to the introduction of the Bill into
Parliament, I am directed to state, that as the Measure is now
intended to be confined to a separation of the Rights and
Interests of the Crown from those of the Proprietors, it seems to
the Commissioners, that any question which may arise respecting
those Rights and Interests may be better discussed by
Communications with them, or with their Solicitor, than they
could be at any Public Meeting.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate

LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org 

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
